## About

Driven full-stack web developer with 3 years experience as a freelancer in the field. Have worked with many international clients on various projects and was always able to meet their expectations. 

My strength lies in strong communication with my client during the workflow. I always make sure me and my client are on the same page about the project, to make sure that the end project is of the best quality and service.

Prefer working with ReactJs and Rails API but my skills also include NodeJS, NextJS, Express, PostgreSQL and Ruby on Rails.
