Always use the new Svelte runes syntax ($state, $derived, etc.) instead of the older reactive syntax, please refer to the svelte docs on runes: https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte/what-are-runes

Always use arrow functions instead of regular function declarations

Prefer const over let unless reassignment is necessary

Make sure to always make the script tag use lang="ts"
